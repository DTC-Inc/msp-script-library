## THIS SCRIPT USES THE WINGET COMMAND TO UPGRADE APPS WITH AVAILABLE UPDATES AND NOT SPECIFIED IN THE EXCLUSION FILE
## THIS SCRIPT ONLY SIMULATES THE UPGRADE CURRENTLY AND DOES NOT UPGRADE ANY APPS

## PLEASE COMMENT YOUR VARIALBES DIRECTLY BELOW HERE IF YOU'RE RUNNING FROM A RMM
## THIS IS HOW WE EASILY LET PEOPLE KNOW WHAT VARIABLES NEED SET IN THE RMM


# Getting input from user if not running from RMM else set variables from RMM.

# No variables are required for this script besides $Description.
